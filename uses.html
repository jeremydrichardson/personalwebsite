    <h1>Uses</h1>
    <p>A quick rundown of the stuff I use.</p>
    <h2>Desktop Apps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Figma - Just started using Figma for prototyping and liking it so far.</li>
        <li>Visual Studio Code - Switched from old school Eclipse a while back and love it. It's a good balance between basic text editor and full blown IDE.</li>
        <li>Chrome - My default browser for now. Really want to use Firefox but haven't quite made the switch yet.</li>
        <li>Magnet - Trying out Magnet for window management now that I have a 27 inch second screen.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Desk Setup</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>LG 27UL600-W - My main 4k monitor that I got recently after trying a couple others.</li>
        <li>ApexDesk Elite Series 71" x 33" - Love this standing desk!</li>
        <li>Rokit 6 - I dabble in music production on the side so having these great studio monitors is just a bonus for my real work.</li>
        <li>CalDigit Thunderbolt 2 - Everything is plugged in through this making it an easy 2 cables (power and thunderbolt) to get docked.</li>
        <li>2015 MacBook Pro - Getting a little long in the tooth but still a workhorse for me. 2.5 GHz i7 with 16GB RAM and 500GB SSD hard drive.</li>
    </ul>
